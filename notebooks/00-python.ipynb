    "## What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high level programming language that is highly accessible to new and experienced software developers. Advantages of Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* easy to write\n",
    "* highly extensible\n",
    "* highly portable\n",
    "\n",
    "These aspects of Python make it great for data scientists who may be less versed in coding. Python however is *slow* and is not suitable for the development of safety or life critical systems. For example, using Python to develop code that runs inside a car (such as power steering and brake control systems) is illegal! This is not only driven by the speed of Python, but also driven by the way Python handles typing, memory allocation, dependency management, and the fact that it is an interpreted language instead of a compiled language. We will talk about these issues more later on when we discuss why we don't usually deploy AI systems in Python for critical applications, even if it is easy to design them in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in many cases the slowness of Python does not negate its benefits for non-real-time and non-safety-critical / non-mission critical applications. There have also been many pursuits to improve the performance of Python, including many *packages* for Python geared for high performance computing. Some of these packages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `numpy`\n",
    "* `numba`\n",
    "* `dask`\n",
    "\n",
    "These can help us write Python code that runs faster and better exploits the resources of our hardware, but it is very important to note that they do not address all the issues of employing Python for critical applications. So, even with these libraries and improvements that have been made to the Python language, we still opt to use (and sometimes are mandated to use per regulations) other languages for critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn about all these considerations soon. Python is an imperfect language, but it has a tremendously large community behind it, and the many years surrounding Python development have enabled the language to effectively be able to do *anything* (even if not entirely well!). As a programming language, there are rules and expected syntax that must be followed. Breaking these rules results in code that does not work, and most of the time results in a critical error. The goal of this lesson is simply to provide a feel for the syntax of Python and help those who may be migrating from other languages and environments."

These documents are called *notebooks* and they allow us to write both *markdown* and *Python* side by side. The Python code can be interactively executed in a *kernel*.

However, it can also lead to confusing and hard to read code where a variable takes on one type at one time and a different type at another time based on the type of data written to it if we are not careful. Tools like `mypy` can help us with this, and we will review these later."
