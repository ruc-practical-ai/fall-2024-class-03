    "Classes enable representing relationships between data (variables) and actions (functions) in our code. Classes are templates for *objects*. We can think of a class like a cookie cutter (for those who like culinary analogies) or a jig (for those who like woodworking analogies) which serve as a template for printing new *instances* of a general pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes enable representing relationships between data and functions which change that data, and also enable representing relationships between objects. For example, we can use classes to specify that a square *is a* rectangle, and a rectangle *has a* side length. Using classes to represent concepts and relationships between them in our code is called *object oriented programming (OOP)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spirit of being kind to those who have to read our code (including our future selves) we use OOP in professional programming to express relationships between the concepts we are representing. We might not often think of software development as a means of self-expression, the same way we think of spoken and written languages (like English, Spanish, or any other language) as a means of self expression. However, when we learn to use classes, we can see the expressive power that programming languages truly have.\n",

    "The linguist John Rupert Firth said\n",

    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "(which is a quote that remains just as relevant to the workings of modern natural language processing algorithms as it was to linguists when Firth first said it). In the same way that spoken languages enable use to tailor the fidelity in which we represent concepts to our listeners by keeping words close to those concepts, classes enable us to tailor the fidelity in which we represent concepts to *future readers of our code* by keeping related concepts together.\n",
    "\n",

    "That is an extreme example of how bad misused OOP can get, but it gets the point across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python provides flexibility to use or not use object oriented paradigms when the do or do not make sense. In general, using object oriented paradigms is preferred when we are communicating to the readers of our code that something has a state (e.g., the toggle of the pen's ink retraction). Using functional programming is preferred when we are representing pure actions (like computing the sum of the squares of two numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clues that we should use object oriented paradigms include:\n",
    "* We find ourselves writing functions that accept far too many parameters (more than 6 parameters)\n",
    "* We find ourselves wishing our functions could remember the values of internal variables between calls\n",
    "* We find ourselves passing around lists of parameters to several functions in our code\n",
    "* We find ourselves wishing that several functions could all access and change the same variables\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if these \"code smells\" are present, we can make them worse by applying object oriented code badly, so we need to be careful to self-assess our code as we are writing it to determine whether or not we should be using OOP and if we decide to use OOP, we need to keep a critical eye on our own work to decide if we need to rewrite it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One metric we can use to rate the quality of our object oriented code in this course is what we will call the ***maintenance information to code ratio***, defined by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Code\\ Quality} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Bullet\\ Points\\ of\\ Useful\\ Information\\ for\\ Maintainers}}{\\mathrm{Lines\\ of\\ Code + Comments}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric demands that we strive to convey the most possible useful points of information to maintainers while giving them the fewest possible lines to maintain. Comments count in the *denominator* because using too many comments means we are not writing code that expresses itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "When in doubt and in need of a self-evaluation of the quality of our code, remember that code is a liability, not an asset. Like any other liability, we might want to use code to get useful tasks done and deem the liability acceptable, but we still want to have as little of the liability as possible. Every line of code we write incurs costs well into the future to run and maintain, and might keep incurring those costs after we're gone from our jobs. Each line of code we write comes with risk that someone in the future will misunderstand it and use it in the wrong way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mitigation against the risk that others will misunderstand our code in the future is to write code that conveys information to the *reader* and not just to the computer, and balance the need to convey as much useful information to the reader as possible to help them maintain the code, with the need to have the least possible code. Good code ensures a good future by walking this middle way between conveying as much useful information as possible to those who have to maintain it, while leaving them the least possible code to maintain."

    "Here we define a simple class to represent cars. Having a `Car` class allows us to quickly generate many cars. Each time we generate a new car, the `__init__()` function is called. This creates all the *member variables* we will use to define a car. We can think of member variables as properties of a car. We can think of member variables as defining adjectives associated with a car. Below the `__init__()` function, we define additional *member functions*. The member functions are actions a car can take (we can think of these as defining verbs that are associated with a car). In general, all members variables represent *\"has a\"* relationships. For example, a car *has a* color, make, and model. All member functions represent a *\"has the ability to\"* relationship. A car has the ability to drive and alert pedestrians."

    "While class members represent *\"has a\"* relationships, class inheritance represents *\"is a\"* relationships. If we want to represent that something is a specific version or variant of a broader thing, then we use class inheritance. Class inheritance, when used properly, can help us increase our maintenance information to code ratio by enabling us to reuse attributes and methods that are common between related objects. This reduces the overall code that we have to write by enabling reuse, and expresses more useful information for maintainers of that code by representing the relationship between the objects in the code itself. No comments are required to explain this! All the information is right there in the code. When we do this well, we say the code is *\"self-documenting\"*.\n",

    "If a class is a more specific instance of a more general class, then we call the more specific class a *child* class and the more general class the *parent* class. Children are said to *inherit* attributes from their parents. In Python, parent classes are often referred to as *super* classes, since the more general class defines a superset of the more specific class. The classic example of inheritance in OOP is rectangles and squares. All squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares. So, it makes sense to implement a square as a child class of a rectangle parent class. When determining whether a class should be a parent or a child, remember that the sentence \"Child Class Name *is a* Parent Class Name\" should make sense. For example, \"Square *is a* Rectangle\" makes sense but \"Rectangle *is a* Square\" does not always make sense!\n",
