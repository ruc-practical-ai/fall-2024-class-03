    "From this point onward we will be writing a lot of code in this course. Here we review some tips for keeping our code clean and easy to maintain!\n",

This will reduce the amount of time you spend working on code and in turn reduce the cost of projects, with compounding returns for complex projects. The more complex the project, the more important software hygiene is.\n",

    "## Write High Quality Code in Python and Call from Notebooks (Rather Than Developing Inside Notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are useful for seeing results of code inline with the code, for explaining ideas with styled markdown next to code, and for keeping plots close to the code that generated them (some which Tufte, the author of the famous Visual Display of Quantitative Information, would appreciate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are also useful for working on code where it is helpful to run blocks of the code out of order, or helpful to run some blocks of code several times before proceeding to the next blocks. For example, Jupyter is a popular tool for training and testing machine learning models, which is why we employ it often in this course. A first set of cells in a machine learning notebook would unpack the data. These cells might be run multiple times until the data scientist is sure the data is extracted correctly. A next set of cells might then train a model from the data to make inferences on new data, providing some metrics on the model after each training run. The data scientist might then repeat these cells multiple times until the metrics are satisfactory before proceeding with testing the model on held out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all excellent use cases for Jupyter. However, developing complex algorithms and systems directly in Jupyter notebooks should be avoided. This is because the ability to run cells out of order can cause unexpected errors if we are not careful about how we store and name our variables. For example, if you have an algorithm that spans multiple cells in a notebook, you might run the first cells after running some middle cells and before running your end cell. This can cause unexpected results. This can be especially dangerous when running cells out of order causes the result in the final cell to be correct for the wrong reason. Then you might think your code works, push it so your teammates can use it, and then realize they cannot reproduce your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be tempted to keep all the code for a single algorithm in a single Jupyter cell to solve this problem. This will introduce other problems for maintainability though. Code (like prose) is easier to read and digest in small blocks. Having code grouped together just to control how your teammates can and cannot execute it in Jupyter is a misuse of Jupyter's cells and will cause your teammates to have to read and digest unnecessarily large blocks of code which is burdensome and time consuming on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to solve this problem is to develop code inside importable, self contained Python modules (individual files) or Python packages (folders structured as importable libraries in Python). Breaking code into separate files can be helpful for all of the following reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Breaking code into separate files ensures that Jupyter notebook cell execution order will not corrupt the state of your variables, without making cells too long.\n",
    "* Each file is independently testable and once determined to be working does not need to be touched again.\n",
    "* Each file can handle a single responsibility (do one thing and one thing well) so that you know exactly where to look if a part of your system or analysis tools are not functioning correctly.\n",
    "* When collaborating with teammates, it will be easier to divide work between files and avoid conflicts when merging with git (so called *merge conflicts*) by working on separate files.\n",
    "* When working on complex projects across multiple organizations, it will be easier to determine what organization is responsible for the code in each file. (This applies in industry, outside the context of this course.)\n",

    "## Write High Quality Documentation in Comments or Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks, Scripts, and Modules\n",
    "As seen in this notebook and many of the other example notebooks in class, remember to write high quality documentation for your code. If writing a notebook, be sure to explain your plots, derive any key equations, and keep plots close to their explanations and related concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If writing a Python script, be sure to include comments. At minimum, include comments at the top of the script stating its purpose, how to use it, and any known issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python modules, use docstrings for each module, function, and class. Adhere to a standard, like the Google Style Guide to make your docstrings consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, README.md files will be mostly made for you. Professionally, you should always make a descriptive README file for any project or repository you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Guidance \n",
    "\n",
    "For any lines that would look surprising to you, explain those with a specific comment. Keep in mind that any time you are writing a comment that explains how your code works, you are probably writing code that is too surprising! Strive to write simpler code that will be self documenting, using variable names, function names, and the structure of the code to make your code read like prose. Save comments to explain why you did something, and let the code itself explain how you did it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all documentation, write as if writing to a teammate or a future version of yourself needing to pick up the project after forgetting about its details and being busy with other projects for a while. Try to momentarily \"switch off\" the part of your mind that has been deeply involved in the code you are writing and look at it with fresh eyes. If it wouldn't make sense to you without having stared at it for a few hours, it will not make sense to you in a few months! Be kind to yourself and explain it in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the further your documentation is away from your code, plots, and any data you are analyzing in the project, the more likely it will be to get out of date. Keep your documentation close to the information it is documenting so when that information changes you (or others) will notice the discrepancy and change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, remember that for any code you write, it should be immediately obvious to anyone you work with (and to anyone who has to run that code) what it does and how to use it. This seems obvious for small projects, but is not always obvious for big projects. A common pitfall in professional settings is for different teams to develop projects that other teams besides their own cannot run. This might be due to undocumented dependencies, writing surprising or unusual code not adhering to the idioms of the language, or simply a complete lack of documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete documentation should explain all of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does the software do?\n",
    "* How can a new user run the software?\n",
    "* What dependencies are required to run the software?\n",
    "* Is any development environment set up required?"

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This is an introductory course and not all assignments will require unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in professional settings, code may not be written unless a test has been written first. Then, only the minimum code required to make the test pass may be written. This practice of TDD is essential to ensuring that code meets requirements and that unneeded costs and liabilities are not incurred due to extra code being written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professionally, many levels of testing are employed for different levels of the system. Unit tests check that each individual function is performing as expected and are essential. If code does not have unit tests, it is not considered maintainable since there is no way to check it is performing as intended once changing it. Additional tests can be employed to ensure that a system functions correctly as a whole, that parts of a system interface correctly with each other, and that a system meets formal requirements specified by a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended unit test frameworks in Python are `unittest` and `pytest`. We will use `pytest` in this course. Unit testing will be covered later in this lesson. Other types of testing for machine learning systems specifically will be covered in later classes.\n"
